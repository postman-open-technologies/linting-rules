# Governance Linting Rules
This is a project for managing linting rules that can be used via a linting API as well natively as a collection in a modular way that can be can be evolve using Github. There are two workspaces currently available for engaging with this projects:

- [Rules]() - A workspace of OpenAPI and Swagger rules you can learn from, execute, fork, and share.
- [Collections] - A workspace with a handful of collections for executing rules in different ways.

If you have any questions about rules you can submit an issue or start a discussion within this repo, and if you have specific questions about applying rules as part of the API lifecycle you can comment on one of the collections in either of the workspaces.
